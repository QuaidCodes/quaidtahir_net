        <h2>Higher Education</h2>
        <p>
          Education is one of, if not the most important part of a person's
          life. Most of the populace spends approximately a quarter of their
          lives in pursuit of a degree; a qualification provided to students
          upon completion of a course of study. My father is a firm advocator
          for higher education; he himself possesses double Master's in
          Political History and Journalism. My father was the first one in his
          family to receive formal education and understands the importance of
          it. He has always supported and encouraged me to do the same. I aspire
          to follow in his footsteps.

          My love for science is hard to describe in words. I have always been
          curious about anything to everything. I suppose it's ingrained in
          human nature. After school, I would spend most of my free time
          watching documentaries and scientific shows on National Geographic
          Channel. I would learn about the age of inventions, technological
          advancements, and great minds who were behind those creations. I would
          idolize Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla.
        </p>

          After watching documentaries on their lives, I concluded that all
          great minds and scholars possess a degree in their respective fields.
          A degree is not just a piece of paper; it is an attestation of your
          conviction and commitment to something you believe in. In this age of
          booming technology where everything is just a click away, I want to
          leave my mark, my legacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legacy is a concept relative to the person. For someone it might be
          leaving an abundance of wealth for future generation or accepting a
          noble prize and etching your name in history or being a loving husband
          and endearing father. To me legacy is leaving the world better than I
          found it. Even if I may not be able to enjoy the fruits of my labor, I
          want to leave it one step closer for the next generation and I want to
          know that I did everything in my power to accomplish that goal.
        </p>

          I dream of someday in which I hold a PhD in Genetic Engineering, a PhD
          in astrophysics, and a bachelor's in computer science. I want to use
          all my knowledge to help humankind as a whole move forward. I have
          pondered about the implications of this journey and the time
          commitment, and it reminds me of a quote from someone I hold dear to
          heart.
